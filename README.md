# TEXT-SUMMARIZATION-TOOL
The Text Summarization Tool is an AI-powered application designed to condense lengthy articles or paragraphs into short, meaningful summaries using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The primary objective of this tool is to extract the most important information from long-form text and present it in a concise form, making content easier and quicker to understand. This is especially useful for students, researchers, and professionals who need to process large volumes of information efficiently.

The tool is built using Python and leverages the HuggingFace Transformers library, specifically the BART model developed by Facebook AI. The summarizer works by identifying key sentences and restructuring them into a brief but coherent summary. A simple graphical user interface (GUI) is created using Tkinter, allowing users to input text, click a button, and instantly receive a summarized output.

This project demonstrates the real-world application of NLP techniques and deep learning models. It also showcases the integration of AI models into user-friendly tools, combining backend intelligence with frontend accessibility. The deliverable is a fully functional Python script that performs text summarization accurately and interactively.
